I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree at Oregon State University working under [Dr. Lizhong Chen's](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~chenliz/) advice. I am currently focusing on computer architecture related research, especially AI assisted computer architecture design. Before this, I also delved into the GPU architecture optimization, especially the memory subsystem. The proposed Cache Access Reordering and Dynamically linked MSHR can significantly improve the memory subsystem efficiency. 

Before joining Oregon State University, I studied at Beijing University of Chemical Technology (BUCT). I got my Master and Bachelor degree from BUCT at 2015 and 2012 separately. At that time, I mainly focused on the embedded system development, which involves biomedical devices, and fault diagnosis devices development.

I am always eager to broaden my horizon through meeting and working with new people in similar fields.
